# G.T Liang

Hi, I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for optimizing system performance. My background in computer science has given me a strong foundation in the principles of data analysis and modeling. I have experience working with various types of data and applying machine learning algorithms to create predictive models and improve decision-making processes.

As a Machine Learning Engineer, I specialize in developing algorithms and systems that are efficient, reliable, and scalable. I enjoy exploring new technologies and techniques to improve the performance of machine learning systems, from data preprocessing to model selection and deployment. I also have experience working with cloud-based platforms and distributed computing systems to handle large-scale data processing and model training.

My expertise in system performance extends beyond machine learning algorithms. I have experience working with software engineering teams to design and implement scalable, performant systems. I understand the importance of balancing performance with other key considerations such as maintainability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.

Overall, my goal is to develop machine learning systems that are accurate, efficient, and scalable, while minimizing the impact on system performance. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to apply my expertise in machine learning and system performance to solve complex real-world problems.
